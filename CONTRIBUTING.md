## Writing Code

We welcome code contributions! To contribute code, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository:** Fork the Lback Framework repository on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your_github_username/lback_framework.git](https://github.com/your_github_username/lback_framework.git)
    cd lback_framework
    ```
3.  **Create a new branch:** Create a new branch for your changes.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name # For new features
    # or
    git checkout -b bugfix/your-bug-name # For bug fixes
    ```
4.  **Set up your development environment:**
    * Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8+).
    * Install the framework's dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -e .[dev] # Assuming you have a [dev] extra in setup.py for development dependencies
        # or
        pip install -r requirements-dev.txt # If you use a requirements-dev.txt file
        ```
    * Set up any necessary configuration (e.g., database).
5.  **Make your changes:** Write your code, fix bugs, or implement features.
6.  **Write tests:** Add tests for your changes to ensure they work correctly and prevent regressions.
7.  **Run tests:** Make sure all tests pass.
    ```bash
    python manage.py test # Or use pytest directly: pytest
    ```
8.  **Check coding style:** Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding style (PEP 8). You can use linters like Pylint and formatters like isort (as seen in the packages list).
    ```bash
    pylint your_module_or_package
    isort your_module_or_package
    ```
9.  **Commit your changes:** Write clear and concise commit messages.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add new feature X" # Example for a new feature
    # or
    git commit -m "fix: Fix bug Y" # Example for a bug fix
    ```
10. **Push your branch:** Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
11. **Open a Pull Request:** Go to the original Lback Framework repository on GitHub and open a new Pull Request from your branch.

## Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting a Pull Request, please:

* **Use a clear title:** Briefly summarize the changes.
* **Provide a detailed description:** Explain the changes you made, why you made them, and link to any related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
* **Ensure tests pass:** Your changes should not break existing tests, and you should add new tests for new functionality or bug fixes.
* **Adhere to coding style:** Make sure your code follows the project's coding conventions.
* **Keep it focused:** Each Pull Request should ideally address a single issue or feature.

## Improving Documentation

Improving the documentation is a valuable contribution! If you find errors, areas that need clarification, or want to add new content, you can:

* Open an issue to report the problem.
* Submit a Pull Request with your suggested changes to the documentation files (usually Markdown or reStructuredText files in a `docs/` folder).

## Reviewing Code

Reviewing Pull Requests is a great way to learn about the project and help maintain code quality. Look for:

* Correctness of the logic.
* Adherence to coding style.
* Adequate test coverage.
* Clarity of the code and comments.
